# Data-Warehouse-Project
## Project Summary:
The primary objective of this project is to create a concept data warehouse using dimensional modelling techniques. Identify the key stakeholders and business requirements for the same. Based on these requirements develop a design schema for the data warehouse. Create the warehouse using any ETL tools. Produce reports in support of the requirements using SSRS and R. Develop an XML schema based on the data warehouse. Implement a part of the data warehouse as graph database using Neo4j technologies.

## Source and background:
The data source that I have used for this project is Northwind.

The Northwind database is a fictional B2B ( Business to Business) trading company that imports and exports specialty food items. It includes data consisting of product information, orders, order details, customer, employee and a few more.
This is one of the most dynamic database as it can be applied to a variety of applications which is why I was very keen on working with this data set.
There is a wide variety of dimensions that can be created for a number of analysis.
Using this source I have created a data warehouse called NW_Trading_DW.
This warehouse is created to maintain optimal ratio of stock to WIP ( Work In Progress) based on their reorder level and ordered quantities. The idea is to ensure customer satisfaction with timely product delivery. 
It also helps keep a track of premium customers, most selling products, supply chain management (SCM) and employee performance.
The key stakeholders include the Employees, Customers and Suppliers.

2.	Customer retention.
3.	Employee incentive Program.
4.	Optimize supply chain management.
